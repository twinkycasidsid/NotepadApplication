# 📝 NotepadApplication  

NotepadApplication is a **simple and efficient note-taking app** built in **Android Studio (Kotlin)**.  
It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes with ease — providing a clean and lightweight interface for managing everyday tasks or reminders.

I created this app to make note-taking more straightforward and distraction-free, without the clutter of unnecessary features. It focuses on simplicity, speed, and reliability.
